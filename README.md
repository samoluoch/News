## Description
In the app, user loads the website and is greeted with different news sources such as BBC, CNN, etc. This is done using a news api that obtains the different information from the respective news platforms.

This will allow them to read any news articles as posted by the news source. Additionally, the users are able to search news by category using the search button available to them.
